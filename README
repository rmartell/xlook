To compile this, you'll need the latest version of the xview library from 

http://www.yorku.ca/logand/macosx/packages/xview-universal.zip

The website is:

http://www.yorku.ca/logand/macosx/index.html

Once you have that, you need to install it.  Once it's installed:

./configure CFLAGS=-arch i386 LDFLAGS=-arch i386

(If you're not on a x86_64 machine, you won't need the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS.  If you get an error about not finding xview, you'll need them.)

then just:

make

Executable can be run directly on newer versions of OSX by just typing 

./xlook

(Newer versions of OS X will autolaunch X11 for you)
